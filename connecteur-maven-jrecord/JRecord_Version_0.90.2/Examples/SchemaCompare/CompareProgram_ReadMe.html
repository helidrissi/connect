<h2>JRecord Compare Programs</h2>
<p>The programs in this directory provide
a simple way to check a <b>new</b> version of <b>JRecord</b> against
the previous version of JRecord. </p>
<p>There are 2 basic programs:</p>

<table border="1">
 <tr><td><a href="WriteJRecordCompareFile.bat">WriteJRecordCompareFile.bat</a></td>
     <td>This program reads through all the <b>Cobol</b>-Copybooks in a supplied directory
     (cobol_copybooks) and writes  the copybooks <i>record</i> and <i>field</i> details (position, length, field-type and decimal etc)
     to a gzipped text 'Layout' file (JRecordCompare.txt.gz).
     <p>This 'Layout' file (JRecordCompare.txt.gz) provides a "<b>baseline</b>"
     that can be used to compare with future version of JRecord.</td></tr>
 <tr><td><a href="RunJRecordCompare.bat">RunJRecordCompare.bat</a></td>
     <td>This program reads through all the <b>Cobol</b>-Copybooks in a supplied directory (cobol_copybooks) 
     and compares the Record, Field details (position, length, field-type and decimal etc) 
     against the "<b>baseline</b>" Record / Field details store in the 'Layout' file (JRecordCompare.txt.gz).
 </td></tr>
</table>


<p>I suggest you create your own Cobol directories, bat/shell scripts and 'baseline' files to test
future versions of JRecord. The more eyes the better.
